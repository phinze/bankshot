```

### Remaining Tasks

1. **Test Real-World OAuth Flow** (Medium Priority)
   - Set up test OAuth provider
   - Create end-to-end OAuth flow test
   - Document OAuth testing process

2. **Create Man Pages** (Medium Priority)
   - Generate man pages for `bankshot` command
   - Generate man pages for `bankshotd` daemon
   - Include installation instructions for man pages

3. **Write Troubleshooting Guide** (Medium Priority)
   - Create dedicated troubleshooting document
   - Add common error scenarios and solutions
   - Include diagnostic commands and procedures

### Next Steps

The core functionality is well-tested and documented. The project is ready for:
- Beta testing with real users
- Performance optimization based on usage patterns
- Additional feature development based on user feedback

### Known Limitations

1. The daemon doesn't expose a proper Stop() method for clean shutdown in tests
2. Some packages (daemon, process) need refactoring to be more testable
3. Integration tests with real SSH connections would require more complex setup

### Recommendations

1. Consider adding GitHub Actions for CI/CD
2. Set up code coverage reporting (e.g., Codecov)
3. Add benchmarks for performance-critical paths
4. Consider adding more detailed logging for debugging
